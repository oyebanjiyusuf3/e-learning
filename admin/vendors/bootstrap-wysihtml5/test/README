To run the tests, just open index.html in your wysihtml5-compatible
browser.

The following files are ported from the wyshtml5 project's unit tests:

browser_test.js
incompatible_test.js
editor_test.js
undo_manager.js

These files should be left more or less alone, for purposes of
maintainability.  Put new tests in the bootstrap_wysihtml5/ directory,
and modify index.html to reference any new files you create.

If you're testing the underlying wysihtml5 library rather the
bootstrap_wysihtml5 jquery plugin wrapper around that library, then
you're probably contributing to the wrong project :).  See
https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5 for that.
